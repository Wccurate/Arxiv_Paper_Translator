# Exception: keep the final output PDF if we want, but usually ignored in source repo.
# For this project, we might want to ignore the output directory entirely except for .gitkeep?
# But user said "file which is usually ignored in both latex and python project". 
# So ignore generated/aux files.

# Project Specific

translation.log
# Keep example inputs? input/ is not ignored.
